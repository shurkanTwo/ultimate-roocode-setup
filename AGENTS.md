# Agent Rules

**Project Language: English** - All code, documentation, and communication should be in English.

Depending on what you're planning, refer to the corresponding rule.

Your workflow should look like this:
1. Implement Feature/Task
    - **Coding**: [agent-rules/coding.md](./agents/coding.md)
2. Adapt Documentation:
    - **Documentation**: [agent-rules/documentation.md](./agents/documentation.md)
3. Test New Features:
    - **Testing**: [agent-rules/testing.md](./agents/testing.md)
4. Save Changes:
    - **Git**: [agent-rules/git.md](./agents/versioning.md)

Please suggest using a subagent when it's possible or necessary. Ask the user if this should really be done.
