A Git commit should be performed after each completed feature or development step.
   - Commit message should be meaningful
   - Format: `feat: <description>` for new features, `fix: <description>` for bugfixes, `docs: <description>` for documentation, etc.
   - Each work package = 1 commit
   - Keep commit messages as short and concise as possible
